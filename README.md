![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/LeoSunSET/SIEMENS_SIMATIC_STEP7_Classic_Algorithms?logo=GitHub)

A set of most classical and useful algorithms for Siemens Simatic Step 7 PLCs.

Covers most old and new Siemens CPUs. Series S7-300, S7-400, TIA S7-1200 and TIA S7-1500.

To fit in a git repository the STL or SCL language is used and a picture of a LAD/FBD is also made available whenever is possible.

## Installing
The initial idea is to provide pieces of code that can easily copied to your project and parameterized as you need.
